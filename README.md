# Academic_Project-Brain-Brusher-Python
Aims to improve a person's vocab by making them learn 1 word everyday. That was the main objective!! Additionally it helps you keep hydrated by reminding you to drink water from time to time :)

**How to use**
1) Run the 'scheduler.py' file (Pass the 'dict' file as a reference to the script)
2) As long as the script is running... you'll keep on getting the reminders
3) To make this effiecient you need to schedule this script using Windows scheduler and automate its execution.
